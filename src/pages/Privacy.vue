    <p>Datafirst Services cares about your privacy. For this reason, we collect and use personal information only as needed to deliver our products, services, websites and mobile applications, and to communicate with you about the same, or as you have requested (collectively, our “Services”). Your personal information includes information such as:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Telephone number</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Our Privacy Policy not only explains how and why we use your personal information that we collect, but also how you can access, update or otherwise take control of your personal information.
    <br>
    If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at <a class="underline" href="mailto:info@datafirstservices.com">info@datafirstservices.com</a>. This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What information we collect, how we collect it, and why</strong>
    <br>
    Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you when you:
    <br>
    complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email); or
    participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.
    <br>
    However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’d highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time):
    <br>
    Cookies and similar technologies on our websites and mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, such as links clicked, pages viewed, and items purchased. Specifically, the data collected relates to your interactions with our site features or third-party features, such as social media plugins, contained within the Services; Internet Protocol (IP) address (for example, to determine your language preference; browser type and settings; the date and time the Services were used; device type and settings; operating system used; application IDs, unique device identifiers; and error data. These technologies also automatically collect data to measure website performance and improve our systems, including metadata, log files, page load time, server response time to optimize DNS resolution, network routing and server configurations. 
    <br>
    Supplemented Data may be received about you from other sources, for example, from publicly available databases, social media platforms, or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records, assess the qualifications of a candidate for employment, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How we utilize information.</strong>
    <br>
    We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2) as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or (3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes:
    <br>
    Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services. We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services. We utilize this information to:
    <br>
    Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Diagnose problems with and identify any security and compliance risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services</li>
      <li>Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal information.
    <br>
    Sharing with trusted third parties. We may share your personal information with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Processing credit card payments</li>
      <li>Serving advertisements (more on this topic below)</li>
      <li>Conducting contests or surveys</li>
      <li>Performing analysis of our Services and customers demographics</li>
      <li>Communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery</li>
      <li>Customer relationship management</li>
      <li>Security, risk management and compliance</li>
      <li>Recruiting support and related services.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    These third parties (and any subcontractors they may be permitted to use) have agreed not to share, use or retain your personal information for any purpose other than as necessary for the provision of Services.
    <br>
    We will also disclose your information to third parties:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets (whether a result of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise), in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; or</li>
      <li>if we sell, buy, merge, are acquired by, or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions, your information may be among the transferred assets.</li>
      <li>In the event we need to share your information to provide the products or services requested, such as in the case of a third party integration authorized by you.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Communicating with you. We may contact you directly or through a third-party service provider regarding products or services you have signed up or purchased from us, such as necessary to deliver transactional or service-related communications. We may also contact you with offers for additional services we think you’ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed to contact you based on legitimate interests. You don’t need to provide consent as a condition to purchase our goods or services. These contacts may include:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Text (SMS) messages</li>
      <li>Telephone calls</li>
      <li>Messenger applications (e.g., WhatsApp, etc.)</li>
      <li>Automated phone calls or text messages</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Transfer of personal information abroad. If you utilize our Services from a country other than the country where our servers are located, your personal information may be transferred across international borders, which will only be done when necessary for the performance of our contract with you, when we have your consent to do so, or subject to the appropriate standard contractual clauses. Also, when you call us or initiate a chat, we may provide you with support from one of our global locations outside your country of origin.
    <br>
    Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
    <br>
    To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we may take reasonable steps to notify you if we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of the legal process.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How we secure, store and retain your data.</strong>
    <br>
    We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate.
    <br>
    We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested and thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal or business purposes. These might include retention periods:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our business operations;</li>
      <li>for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or</li>
      <li>needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <br>
    If you make a request to delete your personal information and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any Services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Age restrictions.</strong>
    <br>
    Our Services are available for purchase only for those over the age of 18. Our Services are not targeted to, intended to be consumed by or designed to entice individuals under the age of 18.

    <br>
    <ul>

      <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>

    </ul>
    <br>

    We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy and any other places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
